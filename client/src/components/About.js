          <h2>Who is Treneese Johnson?</h2>

          <p>
        I’m Treneese — a creative technologist, software engineer, artist, and visionary. My story begins with a paintbrush and a notebook, and today it expands into immersive experiences, secure systems, and culturally rooted ventures. My life’s work lives at the intersection of code, creativity, and community.
      </p>

      <p>
        I began drawing in middle school as a way to process the world, and it quickly bloomed into a deep love for painting. At Clark Atlanta University, where I earned my B.A. in Mass Media Art, I explored filmmaking, screenwriting, and storytelling — all as tools to give voice to the worlds in my mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        I expanded that vision into technology after completing college. I completed a full-stack engineering program at Flatiron School where I learned JavaScript, React, Python, Flask, CSS, and more. My passion for coding is rooted in the same instinct as my painting — to create, to empower, and to make things that matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        I founded and am building <strong>DOKO Battlefield</strong>, a tech-powered combat sports experience rooted in wearables, worldbuilding, and belonging. I’m also creating <strong>Naqi</strong>, a rhythm-based VR combat game, and <strong>ELOS Museum</strong>, a modern art experience built around emotion, play, and identity.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I continue building, I’m also studying cybersecurity — because I believe innovation and safety must go hand in hand. The future needs systems that are both expressive and secure, both imaginative and protected.
      </p>

      <p>
        What makes me unique is the way I blend deep creativity with technical execution, bold imagination with real-world planning, and a heart rooted in clarity and purpose. Whether I’m leading a project or joining a team, I bring vision, precision, and relentless drive.
      </p>

            Outside of tech, I love painting, writing screenplays, spending time with my children, and going on picnics. My favorite color is purple, and I love sunflowers — because they don’t need a bouquet to be bold. They shine on their own, and so do I.
