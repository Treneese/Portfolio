    <p>"My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style." -  Maya Angelou</p>

    <p>My passion for creating began at a young age. I started drawing in middle school as an escape and soon realized I had a natural talent for it. In high school, this escape evolved into a passion for painting, which felt as natural to me as speaking a new language.</p>
    <p>At Clark Atlanta University, where I completed my B.A. in Mass Media Art, I continued to nurture my love for painting while also developing a passion for filmmaking and screenwriting. The ability to create and recreate worlds and share the visions in my mind felt magical.</p> 
    <p>While I still hold on to my love for painting and filmmaking, I've also discovered a passion for coding. To me, coding is about creating digital worlds. Becoming a Software Engineer was a smooth transition because creating is who I am, and that's what Software Engineering is all about. In a way, I've transitioned from the least technical form of creating to the most technical.</p>
    <p>At Flatiron School, I stepped into the world of Full-Stack Software Engineering, learning JavaScript, React, Python, Flask, CSS, HTML, and more. I have completed several projects, both solo and in groups, to showcase my talent and my ability to work independently and collaboratively.</p>
    <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am known for my worldly personality, exceptional communication, detail-oriented approach, and self-motivation. I am dedicated to creating software that improves the art community and media landscape, and I aspire to work at a company that values creativity, diversity, and the intersection of technology and art.

<p>In my free time, I love to spend time with my family, paint, write screenplays/films, and enjoy picnics. Fun facts: my favorite color is purple and sunflowers are my favorite flower. Most flowers need a bouquet to stand out, but sunflowers are bold alone. They shine brightly like the sun, evoke warmth, and remind me of summer.</p>
